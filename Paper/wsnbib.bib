abstract = {Security of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is an important research area in computer and communications sciences. Anomaly detection is a key challenge in ensuring the security of WSN. Several anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed and validated recently using labeled datasets that are not publicly available. Our group proposed an ellipsoid-based anomaly detection algorithm but demonstrated its performance using synthetic datasets and real Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory and Grand St. Bernard datasets which are not labeled with anomalies. This approach requires manual assignment of the anomalies' positions based on visual estimates for performance evaluation. In this paper, we have implemented a single-hop and multi-hop sensor-data collection network. In both scenarios we generated real labeled data for anomaly detection and identified different types of anomalies. These labeled sensor data and types of anomalies are useful for research, such as machine learning, and this information will be disseminated to the research community.},
